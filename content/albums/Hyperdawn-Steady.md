**matt**

Yeah I'm a bit disappointed with steady ngl. Didn't really stick with me at all. I like the last song. Nice ambient. I'll have more thoughts on a third listen but lemme know what you think


**garbhan**

Yeah I listened to it just a few hours ago and I was a little disappointed too. Wasn't bad but none of the tracks really stood out. I will say the glitchy parts are really well done, esp the popping sound on the opener

I don't see myself coming back to this album but I'll check out whatever they do next for sure. oh yeah and the last track was definitely a hightlight


**matt**

Eh I'll listen to what they do next but this one isn't it for me. It has good sounds but the songwriting aspect of it isn't to my taste. I do like the last and first songs the best but I expected more.
