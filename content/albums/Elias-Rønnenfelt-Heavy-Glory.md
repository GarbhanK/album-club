I've been loving Dean blunts album with Elias Rønnenfelt. Been on loop for ages (really good). So my choice is his debut last year

Heavy glory. Why did Dean blunt wanna work with him? It must be good. His voice has grown on me loads through listening to the Dean blunt record

I really like the dare's remix of one of the songs off the album

Love the pick for this month too, really cool. I listened to that Dean blunt collab and liked it but didn't go back

He's the guy from Iceage right?

**matt**

Ooooooo makes sense he's not just a random guy

So, for Heavy Glory

I wasn’t huge on this album, but I don’t have a whole lot of negative things to say about it.

I really enjoyed the country spin on things. I like his voice but it did get a bit samey for me once I was in the back half of the album

Interesting Joanne Robertson feature, probably how he met Dean Blunt?

Some good hooks and songwriting on it, the original and remix of “Close” is great. I liked how some of the tracks were very Lou Reed-ey

Overall I had a good time but didn’t have motivation to go back to it

What do you think of the album?

**matt**

Listened to it again today. I really liked it! The country elements are mixed in fantastically.

I do enjoy how his voice sounds. It could get grating after a while with how much sauce he puts on it but for me the more I listen the more I like.

Second time around it sounds way better to me. Excited for your 2000s album!!!
