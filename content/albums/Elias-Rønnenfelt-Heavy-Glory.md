I've been loving Dean blunts album with Elias Rønnenfelt. Been on loop for ages (really good). So my choice is his debut last year

Heavy glory. Why did Dean blunt wanna work with him? It must be good. His voice has grown on me loads through listening to the Dean blunt record

I really like the dare's remix of one of the songs off the album

Love the pick for this month too, really cool. I listened to that Dean blunt collab and liked it but didn't go back

He's the guy from Iceage right?

**matt**

Ooooooo makes sense he's not just a random guy
