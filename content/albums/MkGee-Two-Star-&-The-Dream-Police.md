I found 2 star from mk.gee really interesting in a way idk.
It's like conventional but not? Have you heard it?
No i super like them. Loads of different styles in the album too
Tbh I'm loving this album so I'd love your opinion on it

I listened to it this morning and really liked it
Only other album I’ve heard to the ML Bush sound well
Sounded very 80s soul-pop inspired too
Production was fantastic, vocals were one of the highlights
Yeah first listen was lovely, going to give it another when I’ve time tomorrow

I kinda love the vocal melodies and production in general.
I get a bit of a frank ocean vibe through it too
