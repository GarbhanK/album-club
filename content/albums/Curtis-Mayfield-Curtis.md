**garbhan**

Curtis Mayfields solo debut. Chicago Soul classic from 1970, political, over a 4.0 on rym

Has one massive hit you’d probably know (move on up) that’s also a recognisable Kanye sample

Haven’t listened to it except for move on up and the opening track. Opener made me want to pick it

I’m really excited for this weeks album


**matt**

You're pulling out classics BRO CHILL

Sounds like it's gonna be a banger

Just from the opening of the first song I'm in love lol
