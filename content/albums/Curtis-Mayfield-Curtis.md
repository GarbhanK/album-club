Curtis Mayfields solo debut. Chicago Soul classic from 1970, political, over a 4.0 on rym

Has one massive hit you’d probably know (move on up) that’s also a recognisable Kanye sample

Haven’t listened to it except for move on up and the opening track. Opener made me want to pick it

I’m really excited for this weeks album


**matt**

You're pulling out classics BRO CHILL

Sounds like it's gonna be a banger

Just from the opening of the first song I'm in love lol


**matt** (end of the week)

So! I really liked curtis. It had a real positive vibe, absolutely adored the opener and move up (related tracks over below and up). Optimistic album even through the people who are darker than blue. I much preferred the funky stuff to the souly stuff. The funk was much more energy to me. What did you think of it???


**garbhan**

Back from the match now. I really loved it, the added strings and stuff associated with Chicago Soul was A1. Move on up is for sure the best song on the album but I found it super consise/consistent

Interesting you picked out the funkier songs as the best because looking back at my favorite tracks they’re mostly souly stuff

The Makings of You got replayed the most, was also a big fan of Miss Black America

I agree opener is such a gem
