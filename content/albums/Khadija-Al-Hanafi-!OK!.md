My choice for this week.

Shes a Tunisian producer making chill footwork that samples trap/jazz/synth pop/lounge and stuff.
I only listened to the first track so it’ll be fresh for me too. Also a 2025 album

I did. Listened to it twice and didn't really find much to hold onto myself.
It's proper Internet music to me and it's fun that the person that made it is from Tunisia but eh.
Lofi hip hop/ footwork type stuff

**Garbhan**

definitely get where you’re coming from, it didn’t have much staying power after a while.
I loved it the first listen but the novelty of the different samples and the fact that its juke/footwork wore off after a bit.
Still have a couple of songs I really like.
Makes so much more sense as a mixtape
