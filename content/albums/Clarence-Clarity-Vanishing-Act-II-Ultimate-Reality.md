I just remembered Clarence clarity and apparently he released an album last year

Could be good

I enjoyed a few of the tracks. It's cool to see how his sound has changed slightly since NO NOW. I was thinking a lot about NO NOW, I had never heard anything like it when I first listened to it back in the day.

I feel this album has more of a hip-hop influence, a bit more beat-heavy. "Rage quitting, quietly" was my favourite track on it. I was busy this week so I didn't have much time with the album, may go back at some point.

what about you?
