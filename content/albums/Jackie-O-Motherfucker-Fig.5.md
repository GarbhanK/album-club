**garbhan**

It’s a free folk/experimental rock album from 2000. It plays with Americana as a genre, apparently they have a free jazz cover of amazing grace on it.

The band has had a revolving door of members, one of which was Weyes Blood. I was interested because it’s part of the “new weird America” scene scene of late 1990s/early 2000s.

**garbhan (following week)**

Last week was so busy I only gave that Jackie o album one listen


**matt**

Same I listened to it on the plane over and really liked it. Good adventure music to me. An instrumental to an comfy weird film


**garbhan**

for the jackie-o album, I was unsure about picking something experimental but I really enjoyed it. There was lots of variety in the instrumentation and the longer songs had me hypnotised in a groove while never dragging or getting boring.

I liked how some of the tracks felt a bit krautrock-ey, probably because of the drums. Some of the samples seemed to be pulled from radio broadcasts? I'm not sure, really cool if they were

My favourite parts were the group vocals that felt like they were recorded from a mic in the middle of a sitting room (go down, old hannah)
