**garbhan**

It’s a free folk/experimental rock album from 2000. It plays with Americana as a genre, apparently they have a free jazz cover of amazing grace on it.

The band has had a revolving door of members, one of which was Weyes Blood. I was interested because it’s part of the “new weird America” scene scene of late 1990s/early 2000s.
